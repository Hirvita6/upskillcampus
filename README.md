Welcome to the Upskill Python Internship Project Repository! This repository showcases a Python project that completed during my internship program.

## How to Run on Your Laptop?
- **1. Install Python:** Ensure Python is installed on your laptop. You can download it from <a href="python.org">python.org</a>.
- **2. Install Libraries:** Open a terminal and install the required libraries using **pip install cryptography sqlite3**.
- **3. Save the Code:** Save the provided code snippets into a single Python file, e.g., **PasswordManager.py.**
- **4. Run the Code:** Open a terminal, navigate to the directory where password_manager.py is saved, and run the script using **python PasswordManager.py.**
<p>This will launch the command-line interface for your password manager, allowing you to store, retrieve, and generate strong passwords.</p>
